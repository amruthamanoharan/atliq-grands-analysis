# Atliq Grands Data Analysis Using Python

## Project Overview
Atliq Grands is a fictional hotel chain facing challenges from competitors, resulting in declining revenue and market share. This project analyzes booking data to identify actionable strategies for improving performance.

## Problem Statement
Atliq Grands operates across Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Bangalore, with multiple hotel categories (e.g., luxury, budget). Booking data from various channels (e.g., website, third-party platforms) was analyzed to:
1. Understand booking patterns.
2. Identify revenue and occupancy trends.
3. Provide recommendations for business improvement.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For analysis and visualization

## Key Findings
1. **Revenue Trends**:
   - Significant decline in revenue in Tier-1 cities.
   - Luxury hotels show better resilience compared to budget categories.
2. **Booking Channel Performance**:
   - Third-party platforms drive most bookings but have higher acquisition costs.
3. **Occupancy Trends**:
   - Occupancy rates drop sharply on weekdays, indicating a lack of business travel bookings.
4. **Room Type Usage**:
   - Premium and presidential suites have high profitability but low occupancy.

## Recommendations
1. **Competitive Pricing**:
   - Introduce dynamic pricing for weekdays to attract business travelers.
2. **Channel Optimization**:
   - Focus on direct bookings through the website to reduce dependency on third-party platforms.
3. **Targeted Marketing**:
   - Create loyalty programs and targeted campaigns for high-value customers.
4. **Operational Improvements**:
   - Increase utilization of premium room categories through bundled offers.

## How to Use
1. **Data**:
   - The `data/` folder contains sample datasets and descriptions.
2. **Analysis**:
   - Open `notebooks/analysis.ipynb` for the complete analysis.
3. **Visualizations**:
   - Explore key insights in the `visuals/` folder.
